## Next Steps:
- Use TheMealDb API recipes in my model so users can click on recipes to show it's details in the recipe list show view.
- Add a button to the recipe show page that adds that recipe to a list. List selected with a dropdown populated with the already existing lists. If there are no lists the button will take you to the create list page. 
- Add ingredients to the recipe show page. (The API is a bit tricky to work with)
- Add a sort functionality to the recipes index page. (Ex. sort by cook time, no. of ingredients, etc.)
